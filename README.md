<legend>📌 Project Title: Personalized Treatment Optimization using Reinforcement Learning</legend>
</h1>
</div>


<div class="overview">
<h2>🎯 Objective:</h2>
<p>To develop a reinforcement learning-based system that can recommend personalized medical treatments for patients by learning optimal strategies from historical clinical data. The goal is to maximize patient outcomes such as recovery rates, minimize side effects, and adapt treatment over time based on patient response.</p>

<div class="background">
<h2>🧠 Background:</h2>
<p>Traditional medical treatment often relies on fixed protocols or physician experience, which may not be optimal for every individual. Personalized medicine aims to tailor treatments based on specific patient characteristics (e.g. genetics, medical history, lifestyle).

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is well-suited for this task because:
<ol>
It can model sequential decision-making (e.g., treatment over time).

It learns optimal policies based on feedback (rewards) from the environment (patient outcomes).</ol>
